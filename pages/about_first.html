FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a world-wide organization started
by Dean Kamen. It was designed to encourage students to pursue careers in science and technology,
and to instill a sense of Gracious Professionalism. Gracious Professionalism encourages students to work
together to help other teams when needed and to treat everyone with kindness and respect. Because of
this, FIRST is said to not only teach students to build robots, but to build character as well.

The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) which our team competes in is &quot;the varsity sport of the mind.&quot;
FRC students have six weeks to design, prototype and build fully functioning competition robots that
can perform a certain task, which changes every year. In addition to having a robot, it is important and
is encouraged for teams to develop a strong sense of themselves and to market themselves and their
robots at competitions.

The FRC program reaches almost 60 thousand students across 12 different countries including Chile,
Australia and Turkey. Each season these students compete against one another at various regional
competitions across the United States and in their own countries. Each team is fighting for a spot at the
World Championship which is to be held in St. Louis, Missouri in April 2012.
