	FIRST Robotics Team 2471, Team Mean Machine, is based out of Camas, Washington.
	We build robots to operate at competitions on the regional and national level. Our
	current team membership totals at 27 students, and 15 mentors. We hold numerous
	titles from our regional competitions in Portland, Seattle and the World Championships (if
	qualified) in St.Louis. Students are selected for our team based on the same principle that
	began the FIRST organization: their interest in science and technology! We are dedicated
	to: safety in our work, innovation in our creations, excellence in our designs and gracious
	professionalism within our community.

	"Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging
	them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology
	skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-
	confidence, communication, and leadership." -FIRST

	The team gives back to the community by doing numerous science, technology and robotic
	related projects for the elementary schools and for the Parks and Recreation Group.
	</p>

	In addition to the technical aspect of the robots, students connect with various industry
	sponsors and conducts team fundraisers to earn the finances required to support the
	operation.

	Recruiting takes place at many events where we demonstrate our past robots. Although
	primary membership is from Camas High school, the team supports students from two other
	schools in SW Washington, Hockinson and Washougal. As new students sign up, they are
	invited to come to meetings where we work to find the specialty, or sub-team, that best
	suits each student. The build team is usually divided into four sub-teams; programming/
	electrical, chassis, manipulator and Public Relations/Media. Once a student has found an
	area they particularly enjoy, the students work with the team's mentors and other students
	in that area to advance their skills. Some students have a broad interest in many team
	aspects and regularly move between different sub-teams. This is important because it
	allows for better communication between the sub-teams and continuous updates on the
	robot when in build session.
